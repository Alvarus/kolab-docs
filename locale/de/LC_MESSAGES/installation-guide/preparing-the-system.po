"When installing the Kolab server, we recommend using LVM when partitioning "
"the system. The following directories could benefit from being on separate "
"logical volumes, leaving about 10% of raw disk space in the volume group "
"unallocated:"

"Partition and/or divide into logical volumes, configure the mount points and"

"Should you decide to partition only after the packages have already been "
"installed, or after the deployment has already been used, first mount the "
"filesystems somewhere else and synchronize the contents from the original "
"directories over to the new filesystem hierarchy. Please note services "
"should be stopped before doing so, or only corrupt data will be transfered. "
"Remove the original contents of the filesystem after having synchronized, "
"then mount the filesystems under their target mount points."

"For large or multi-domain installations, we suggest moving "
"``/var/lib/imap/`` and ``/var/spool/imap/`` to "
"``/srv/imap/[$domain/]config/`` and ``/srv/imap/[$domain/]default/`` "
"respectively. In allowing ``/srv/imap/`` to be one separate partition, "
"backup using LVM snapshots is easier. Note that ``$domain`` in the "
"aforementioned path is optional, and should only be used when multiple, but "
"separate, isolated IMAP servers are to be started."
