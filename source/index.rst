About Kolab Groupware
=====================

Kolab Groupware is a Free Software groupware solution for Email
communications, Events & Appointments, Contacts and more. It supports
*mixed client environments* because of an *open storage format*, and the
use of well-established, standard protocols such as IMAP and SMTP.

For the full Kolab experience, you need a Kolab server, and one or more
Kolab clients. What makes Kolab a unique groupware solution is its focus
on security, scalability, data ownership (aka privacy) and the use of
proven components and protocols.
