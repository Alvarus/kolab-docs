HOWTO: Create a User in the Kolab Web Administration Panel
==========================================================

This is a quick walk-through guide on creating a user in the Kolab Web
Administration Panel (WAP for short), based on a default Kolab installation.

For customization, please see the :ref:`admin`.

#.  Navigate to the ``/kolab-webadmin`` URL on your webserver using HTTP. For
    example, a server set up on localhost would be at
    http://127.0.0.1/kolab-webadmin.

    .. NOTE::

        The address you use to connect to the web administration panel is also the
        address the server software uses itself.

        If you navigate to the web administration panel using
        http://kolab.example.org/kolab-webadmin, then the software itself will
        (attempt to) connect to http://kolab.example.org/kolab-webadmin/api.

        Make sure the server resolves the address you use (back to itself), or
        use the ``api_url`` setting in the ``kolab_wap`` section of
        :manpage:`kolab.conf(5)`.

#.  Login using the username ``cn=Directory Manager`` and the corresponding
    password you supplied during the setup process.

#.  The screen that follows shows you the objects the web administration panel
    can manage:

    .. figure:: images/kolab-webadmin-objects.png

#.  Choose "Users" to create your initial user account.

#.  Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the layout of our web
    administration panel:

    *   On the left-hand side is a list of existing user records,
    *   Quick links to other object types are provided at the top,
    *   At the right-hand side, near the top, under ``Logout`` and ``About`` is
        a link ``Add User``. :ref:`faq-no-add-user-button-or-link`?
    *   The main screen real estate is spent on the form area:

        .. figure:: images/kolab-webadmin-create-user-1.png

    *   The form is generated from configuration settings, among which a variety
        of types of individual users. A short overview of the types of users
        Kolab ships by default is available in the administrator guide.

#.  For now we would like you to select the ``Kolab User`` type:

    .. figure:: images/kolab-webadmin-create-user-2.png

#.  The form updates itself once you select the ``Kolab User`` type, reflecting
    the configured as well as necessary form fields for this type of user, such
    as mail quota settings. The background color of the form fields indicates
    whether or not the form field requires you to provide input:

    *   light-blue fields are mandatory,
    *   white fields are optional,
    *   gray fields are disabled for custom entry.

    Fields that are disabled are usually generated using values (that you
    supply) in other form fields.

#.  Provide some of the required information, such as the ``Given Name`` and
    ``Surname``.

    *   As you leave each field, the information you typed is being sent back to
        the server (if the form field beared any relevance to any other form
        field), to obtain the values of generated form fields.

        For example, supply the ``Given Name`` (and/or ``Surname``) of the user,
        and see the ``Common name`` and ``Display name`` are populated.

    .. figure:: images/kolab-webadmin-create-user-3.png

#.  User information is being populated in other tabs of the form as well, such
    as the ``Primary Email Address`` and ``Secondary Email Address(es)`` fields
    in the ``Contact Information`` tab:

    .. figure:: images/kolab-webadmin-create-user-4.png

    .. NOTE::

        Note that the primary email address form field is disabled for input, as the
        primary email address is generated by the :ref:`admin_rcpt-policy`.

#.  Select the ``System`` tab.

    If the user you are currently creating is to become a Kolab Administrator,
    start typing ``kolab-admin`` in the ``Role(s)`` field.

    .. figure:: images/kolab-webadmin-create-user-5.png

    .. NOTE::

        The ``Unique identity (UID)`` field is generated using the surname and
        preferred language of the user. A second user with a surname of "Doe"
        will have UID ``doe2``, a third ``doe3``, etc.

    .. NOTE::

        In the default configuration the password field is a cleartext field, so
        you can let the user know what password to use, while not having to
        make one up yourself first -- avoiding too many incidences of the *1234*
        and *Welcome123* passwords.

        Adjusting this configuration is beyond the scope of this topic, but is
        described in the Administrator Guide.

#.  Additional Kolab related configuration is available in the *Other* tab:
