``kolab_cache``
===============================

This setting controls whether Kolab Groupware data and metadata is being cached.

Caching helps, especially since the data is stored in a relation database. The
structure of how information is cached accelerates views such as "this week", or
"this month" in the Calendar, and sorting and pagination for address books.
