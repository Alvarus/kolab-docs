``memcache_hosts``
==================

Configure a list of memcached hosts to use for caches and/or storage.

Usually, it is sufficient to use one memcached host address in this list, and
this one memcached host address might be a load-balanced, high-availability
replicated memcached cluster.

Replicated memcached is available and supported only as part of Kolab Enterprise
13, however.

Use multiple addresses in case the size of all information stored exceeds the
capacity of one (replicated) memcached host.
