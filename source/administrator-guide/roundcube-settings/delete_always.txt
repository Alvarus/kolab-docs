.. _admin_roundcube-settings_delete_always:

``delete_always``
=================

This setting controls whether mail should be deleted, even when moving
the mail to the Trash folder fails.

.. NOTE::

    This setting has no effect in a default Kolab Groupware
    installation, which does not attempt to move the mail to the Trash
    folder in the first place.
