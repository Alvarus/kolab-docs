.. _admin_roundcube-settings-assets_path:

``assets_path``
===============

The ``assets_path`` setting controls where Roundcube (and also plugins)
point the user's browser to to obtain static content such as skin markup
files (Cascaded Style Sheets or CSS files) and JavaScript files,
commonly referred to as :term:`assets`.

In combination with :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings-use_secure_urls`,
which enforces a dynamic base URL to Roundcube, this helps the browsers
retain their cached assets and prevents page load times from increasing.
