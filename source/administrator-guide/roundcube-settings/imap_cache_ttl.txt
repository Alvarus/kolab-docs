.. _admin_roundcube-settings_imap_cache_ttl:

``imap_cache_ttl``
==================

The Time To Live (TTL) for the IMAP caches -- the time it should be considered
valid, or expunged from the current caches at the first opportunity.

Really applicable when used alongside a caching technology that allows the
retention to be specified upon entry, and purges caches automatically.

This setting controls, for example, how long folder lists are retained in cache.

With the folder list being cached, should the user create a folder and subscribe
the folder (using a different client), than the web client session will have to
wait for as long as the :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_imap_cache` is within its
defined TTL before it is made visible automatically, or, alternatively, the user
might look in his Settings > Folders to bypass caches and refresh the folder
list.
