.. _admin_roundcube-settings_db_dsnr:

``db_dsnr``
===========

The database URI read-only operations.

Read operations are executed against this URI, but -- by default -- only if
there is no penalty requiring Roundcube to reconnect or separately connect to
this DSN after one or more write operations.

In a replicated database environment, the write vs. read operations might be
balanced unfairly -- see :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_db_dsnw_noread`.
