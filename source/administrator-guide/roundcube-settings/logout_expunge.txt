``logout_expunge``
==================

Expunge a user's INBOX upon logout. To expunge a user's INBOX means to
issue an *EXPUNGE* command to the IMAP server, deleting all messages
from the mailbox that have previously been flagged as \Deleted.

.. NOTE::

    Note that this requires a successful logout, and does not kick in
    when the browser (tab) is simply closed.
