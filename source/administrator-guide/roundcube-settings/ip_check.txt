``ip_check``
============

Enforce a session may only come from one source IP address.

Should a user be a roaming user -- for example, connect from one source
IP address that is one Wifi network, and later connect from another
source IP address that is another Wifi network -- then enabling the IP
check using this setting will force the existing session to be
invalidated, and require the user to login again.

This is useful for paranoid tracking of user's session validity with as
many parameters as possible, but also has major caveats.

To have to login again is not user-friendly, and some networks employ
load-balanced outgoing connections (with help of proxies) -- meaning
that the user may appear to come from two or more separate source IP
addresses, while in fact the user has not been roaming.
