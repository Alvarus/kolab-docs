``login_autocomplete``
======================

Enable or disable parts of the login form to allow for auto-completion.

This setting knows three distinct values:

*   ``0``, meaning no parts of the login form should be remembered by
    the browser.

*   ``1``, meaning the login username may be remembered.

    .. NOTE::

        Note that the login username is a regular form field, and as
        such it may be difficult for the user to opt-out of remembering
        the form field value.

*   ``2``, meaning the login username and password may both be
    remembered.

    .. WARNING::

        This leaves the user to choose whether or not to store the
        password using the browser, but still implies the login username
        is remembered -- without too many options to opt-out of that.

        As such, this setting should only be set to ``2``, if the users
        are known to only use private and personal computers.

The default in Kolab Groupware is to indicate to the browser no form
field values should be remembered (``0``).
