``messages_cache_ttl``
======================

Messages are usually displayed ordered by date (of submission or arrival), with
the most recent few first.

In effect, this tends to result in a view that does underappreciate older
messages -- they are not regularly displayed in the user's mail (list) views.

Since these messages are only retrieved occasionally, it makes sense to not
spend too much cache capacity on these messages.

Set ``messages_cache_ttl`` to the maximum amount of time that may have
passed since the message became available, during which caching is still
considered appropriate.

.. NOTE::

    A rule of thumb for establishing the appropriate TTL for the messages cache
    would be to cache 2 times a single
    :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_mail_pagesize` for any one mail folder (using
    the default, that would amount to 80 messages).

.. rubric:: Example: Low-turnover Sites

Example settings with only a few mails per week per mail folder, and not too
many users.

.. code-block:: php

    $config['messages_cache_ttl'] = '3m';       # Three months

.. rubric:: Example: High-turnover Sites

.. code-block:: php

    $config['messages_cache_ttl'] = '5d';       # 5 days

.. NOTE::

    The ``messages_cache_ttl`` does not impact the
    :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings-plugin_libkolab_kolab_cache`, but may impact
    the applicability of
    :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings-plugin_libkolab_kolab_messages_cache_bypass`
    being set to ``0``.
