.. _admin_roundcube-settings-use_secure_urls:

``use_secure_urls``
===================

Improve the system's security by enabling the use of secure URLs.

Using secure URLs is to say that once a user's session is authenticated,
the session is directly correlated with a unique URL that is very hard
to guess. This way, so-called Cross-Site Rquest Forgery attacks can be
prevented.

.. NOTE::

    Using this setting, which is enabled in Kolab by default, requires
    the use of a mod_rewrite ruleset such as the following:

    .. parsed-literal::

        RewriteRule ^/roundcubemail/[a-f0-9]{16}/(.*) /roundcubemail/$1 [PT]

.. versionadded:: roundcubemail-1.0.1
    Available for Kolab Enterprise 13

.. versionadded:: roundcubemail-1.1
    Available with Kolab 3.3
