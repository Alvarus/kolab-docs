.. _admin_roundcube-settings_mail_pagesize:

``mail_pagesize``
=================

The ``mail_pagesize`` setting is a user preference default, meaning users can
normally edit this preference in their settings.

The user's preferred ``mail_pagesize`` causes the mail view to list as many
individual messages (list view) or as many threads (thread view) to be displayed
in message lists.

To lock down the ``mail_pagesize`` to a value and not allow users to indicate
and configure their own preference, use
:ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_dont_override`:

.. code-block:: php

    $config['dont_override'] = Array('mail_pagesize');

To establish a maximum page size users may select, see
:ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_max_pagesize`.
