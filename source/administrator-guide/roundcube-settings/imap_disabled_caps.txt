.. _admin_roundcube-settings_imap_disabled_caps:

``imap_disabled_caps``
======================

Specify a list of capabilities to filter from the capabilities advertised by the
server.

Useful if you do not have control over the server, so useless for Kolab
Groupware deployments in production (but useful again in testing and
development).

Examples of capabilities advertised by a server that you may want to disable
include ESEARCH for UW-IMAP.

Default: ``Array()``
