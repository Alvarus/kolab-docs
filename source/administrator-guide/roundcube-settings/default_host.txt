.. _admin_roundcube-settings_default_host:

``default_host``
================

The ``default_host`` setting configures the IMAP server address to connect to,
and if omitted, allows the user to specify the IMAP server address.

A drop-down select list could be provided by configuring ``default_host`` as
follows:

.. code-block:: php

    $config['default_host'] = Array(
            'imap.example.org',
            'tls://imap.gmail.com',
            (...)
        );

To show user-friendly, legible labels instead of server addresses, give each of
the items in the list a value:

.. code-block:: php

    $config['default_host'] = Array(
            'imap.example.org' => "Example",
            'tls://imap.gmail.com' => "GMail",
            (...)
        );

Neither of these options is used by Kolab Groupware. By default, the
``default_host`` is set to ``tls://localhost``.

For environments with multiple parent or alias domains, and hosted environments,
and co-located service providers, we recommend using the file inclusion method
outlined at the very start of the :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings`, for the
flexibility required in such environments is likely to exceed just the IMAP
server address to use.

Furthermore, Kolab Groupware really likes the Cyrus IMAP Murder topology, where
the IMAP server address used to connect to matters less.
