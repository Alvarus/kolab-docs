``db_persistent``
=================

Whether or not ``pconnect()`` or simply ``connect()`` capabilities should be
used if at all available.

Persistent connections, as the name suggests, are not closed when the processing
of a request ends. When using persistent connections, you're trusting the
verification routines that PHP applies to make sure a connection that was
around already, and is being re-used, is not suddenly privileged more or less
than it should be, and is the right database server and database.

You enable persistent connections to reduce the overhead of needing to build new
database connections on every request.
