.. _admin_roundcube-settings_db_dsnw_noread:

``db_dsnw_noread``
==================

Only applicable if :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_db_dsnr` is set to a non-empty
value not equal to :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_db_dsnw`, this setting adjusts
the default behaviour of Roundcube with regards to database read operations.

By default, when Roundcube writes out to a database, subsequent read operations
are executed over the same database connection.

This may not be desirable in a replicated database environment, for most page
hit (by far) include one or more write operations against the database,
resulting in write vs. read operations being unfairly balanced between the write
master(s) and read-only slave(s).

Set ``db_dsnw_noread`` to ``true`` to ensure all read operations are executed
against read slave(s) rather then write master(s), despite the potential
overhead in needing to create a new database connection, and regardless of the
read slave(s) potentially lagging in replication.
