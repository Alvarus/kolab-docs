.. _admin_roundcube-settings_autocomplete_addressbooks:

``autocomplete_addressbooks``
=============================

Specify a list of address books to search for auto-completion.

The list includes the names of address books as they are defined in
:ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public` -- i.e. we start that section by
naming 'addressbook1' and 'addressbook2', and those are the names you use here.

.. NOTE::

    Names of Kolab address books do not need to be included in the list of
    address books to use for autocompletion.
