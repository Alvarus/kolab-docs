``per_user_logging``
====================

Extremely useful for production sites with a lot of traffic, that want to debug
a particular user.

Normally, debugging is enabled on a global level -- this is not feasible for two
reasons:

#.  Your disk I/O for logging and incurred latency in processing requests goes
    through the proverbial roof (though more likely literally).

#.  The way logging is implemented does not make a user session, or the log
    items related to a given user, very recognizable. An insurmountable heap of
    log messages would require analysis, and you could probably throw away 99.9%
    of the logs you collected.

This setting, when turned on, enables an administrator to make a user-specific
directory writeable for the webserver user.

If this option is enabled, and the directory for a particular exists, only then
is all debugging turned on, and only for the relevant user.

.. rubric:: Example Usage

#.  User "John Doe <john.doe@example.org>" has a problem.

#.  Enable ``per_user_logging``, and create the directory for the user:

    .. parsed-literal::

        # :command:`mkdir -p /var/log/roundcubemail/john.doe@example.org`
        # :command:`chown apache /var/log/roundcubemail/john.doe@example.org`

#.  Get a cup of coffee while John reproduces his problem.

#.  Disable ``per_user_logging``.

.. WARNING::

    Do not "just" enable ``per_user_logging`` for the sake of it. The amount of
    stat() calls executed are, for busy sites, causing your production to run
    far from optimally.
