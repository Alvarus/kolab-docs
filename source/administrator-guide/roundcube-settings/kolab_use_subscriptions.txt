===============================

.. versionadded:: roundcubemail-plugins-kolab-3.0.1

When listing folders with groupware content available for display,
should all folders to which the user has access be listed, or should
only those folders to which the user is subscribed be included?

The value ``false`` means all folders to which the user has access will
be included.

The default for a Kolab Groupware deployment is ``true``.
