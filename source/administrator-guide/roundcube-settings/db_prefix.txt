``db_prefix``
=============

Prefix Roundcube's table names with the prefix configured here.

When, for example, only a single database is available to you, should multiple
applications you wish to run both have a table named ``users``, than specify a
``db_prefix`` to make sure the Roundcube table for users can be created next to
an existing table ``users``, and avoid the conflict in the schema definitions
for the tables.

.. rubric:: Example Configuration

.. code-block:: php

    $config['db_prefix'] = 'rc_';
