``imap_delimiter``
==================

Set the delimiter to use in IMAP.

Be warned that the delimiter is a hierarchy element (i.e., for nested folders),
and often has implications if configured incorrectly.

The default is not configured, so that the results of the IMAP command NAMESPACE
are interpreted. This is the recommended setting, and we suggest you only fiddle
with this setting should your IMAP server not support the NAMESPACE command.
