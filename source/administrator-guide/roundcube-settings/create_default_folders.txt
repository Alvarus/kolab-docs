``create_default_folders``
==========================

Whether or not Roundcube should create the default folders configured
for the user.

This includes, for example, the folders for sent items and the trash
folder.

.. NOTE::

    In a Kolab Groupware environment, a set of default folders is
    usually created by the Kolab daemon. Which folders are created is
    controlled through the ``autocreate_folders`` setting in
    :manpage:`kolab.conf(5)`.
